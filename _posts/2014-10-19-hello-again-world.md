It's time for the tri-annual reboot of my website.  This is built
using [Jekyll][jk] and [Bootstrap][bs], and hosted using
[GitHub Pages][gp].  I am, at the moment, optimistic about the
simplicity and flexibility of this setup.

Some additional features I hope to implement some time soon:

  * Tagging
  * Comments
  * Flair
