I happen to have had the fortune to get my hands on a first generation
iPad when it first came out.  I never did, and still don't really find
much value in it, though I will pick it up if I want to read something
that doesn't display nicely on my phone, or I'm upgrading the
operating system on my laptop.

Well, I used to pick it up for such things.  It is now unusably slow
for most stuff I'd want to do, and at some point Apple decided it was
obsolete, and stopped allowing updates to the operating system, and
by extension stopped allowing any new applications to be installed.

I did figure out one way to extend it's value.  I put it on a stand on
a bookshelf to display time and weather, just by using the already
installed web browser.  If I were more ambitious, I would make it
pretty, and use some sort of real weather API, but I'm not, so I just
made
[a page with an iframe pointing to Accuweather that refreshes once an hour][1].

If you live in Chicago, or are just interested in what the weather is
like there, dust off your old iPad and point it at
